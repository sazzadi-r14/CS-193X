Job applications and resume tailoring are crucial but often stressful aspects of the job search process.
 It requires careful understanding and matching of job requirements, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. 
 So I am trying to build a system that leverages a language model to analyze job positions and auto-suggest 
 improvements to a candidate's resume.


Goals
1. To build a system that accurately understands and interprets the requirements from a given job description.
2. Using GPT-3/4 to suggest specific and relevant changes to an individual's resume based on these job requirements.
3. To ensure the system can output an updated, tailored resume based on these suggestions, and fit it on the templates.
4. (Stretch Goal) To implement a feature that uses the applicant's and the referrer's LinkedIn profile to construct 
a meaningful and relevant referral request. I plan on using LinkedIn authentication for the process.
